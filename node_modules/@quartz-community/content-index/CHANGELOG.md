## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Respect the `file.data.unlisted` convention. Pages marked `unlisted` are skipped entirely — they do not appear in `contentIndex.json`, RSS, or sitemap. Used by `@quartz-community/encrypted-pages` to hide encrypted pages from discovery surfaces while keeping their HTML accessible by direct URL.
- Skip `richContent` for pages marked `file.data.encrypted === true` even when `rssFullHtml: true` is set. Prevents the ciphertext blob from bloating RSS feeds.
- Test suite with coverage for unlisted/encrypted exclusion behavior.

- Initial Quartz community plugin template.
